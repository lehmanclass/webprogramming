FOR THE ETRA CREDIT I USED FLEXBOX CSS AND THREE MORE PAGES 



# webprogrammingproject1

Here is the description of this project.

-after i click on an element with #grading-element-one, i will find a #grading-element-one-consequence added to the DOM

-after i click a link with id tag #grading-element-two, the page will redirect to a /about page. This new page should have a #grading-element-one-consequence element.

-after i click an element with id tag #grading-element-three, a not-visible element #grading-element-three-consequence will be visible (hint: do not use display: none & display: block)

-there is a form (can be hidden) with name grading-element-four that when submitted, will POST to http://localhost:3000/form and the form payload must have truthy values for three keys: testOne, testTwo, TestThree.

-there is an element with id #grading-element-five that has a css color value, that changes to a new color value when the mouse hovers over it.

So i decided to create a barbershop website where client will be able to see the services provided by the store and also be able to make appointement by submitting a form directly to the barber .
In addition to that i created a button to client can show their support to the local business by making donation.

i used flexbox and css to make the page user freindly and easy to used , i'm still looking forward to improve this project inthe near future by using react and be able to impliment more thecnolgy to it
